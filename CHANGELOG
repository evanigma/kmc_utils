Wed Sept 1, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.3.2

    * Autoprobes ROM to fix BIOS error in reporting record rate.

    * kmc_serial: Fixed faster shutter speed reporting

    * kmc_serial: Fixed trigger mode setting so it doesn't change 
      random mode # frames

    * kmc_read: Fixed bug preventing transfering from RANDOM trigger mode

    * kmc_control: Added Time Lapse Triggering

    * README: Added information about Random Triggering which is
      not present in any Kodak documentation.

    * kmc_serial & kmc_control: Added support for PAL video playback.
      This has not been tested since I do not have a PAL system.

Fri Aug 23, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.3.1

    * Added smart mode switching for serial.

    * Fixed device setting with -d flag.

    * Added #ifdef correction to compensate for bug in early ROM versions
      when reporting record rate.

    * Fixed many bugs, updated documentation, and cleaned up code.

Wed Aug 18, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.3.0

    * Merged kmc_serial.c and kmc_control.c contributed by
      Dan Blair.

    * Cleaned up package a bit by throwing out some old junk
      (incl. kmc_view, which was too slow)

Fri May 14, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.2.6

    * Added kmc_speedtest for benchmarking.  I did this very quickly
      and more thought should go into it.
 
    * Added kmc_play.  This requires a recent Gtk+ (with gtkrgb) and
      is not working nicely at all.  It is a start, and may even be 
      useful in its current pathetic state.

    * kmc: small changes for kmc_speedtest and kmc_play.  

Tue May 11, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.2.5

    * kmc: Fixed bug in sending color image to STDOUT in ppm format

    * kmc: Fixed bugs in writing color images as gray image data

    * kmc_read: Fixed file name generation for sequences of ppm images.

Mon Apr 19, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.2.4

    * README: Added notes regarding disfunctionality of kmc_view.pl
              and lack of support for tiff image format.
              Also added more details on building kmc_read for
              users who do not have SWIG.

    * Makefile: Took "all" away as a requirement for install, so
                users can install without kmc_wrap.c being compiled.
                Removed kmc_view.pl from installation and uninstallation
                procedures.  Added kmc_view.8 to installation and 
                uninstallation.

	* kmc_read.8: Updated man file to have "-T" flag and to point
                  out that tiff format is not yet supported.

    * kmc_view.8: Wrote a brief man page to indicate it is in
                  development.

    * kmc_utils-0.2.4-1.spec: Added kmc_view.8 to this file.

Sat Apr 17, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.2.3

    * Finished color interpolation.  This is not the algorithm Kodak
      uses.  This one is simpler, but until I understand why Kodak
      is using a more complicated interpolation method, I like
      the simple one.


Tue Apr 13, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.2.2

    * Modified color image code. Added -T option to return coloring as
      given on CCD.  Default is to interpolate colors.  Interpolation
      looks good, but is not done at edges and is not quite right.  This
      will be fixed in 0.2.3.


Fri Mar 5, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>
	
    * Version 0.2.0

    * Merged support for color KMC's written by Dan Blair and Jan (?). 

    * Added information on "on-the-fly" device installation to README,
      for those of us who have to share but don't want to keep rebooting.

    * Added a NOTE about color KMC's to the kmc_read man page.


Wed Mar 3, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>
	
    * Version 0.1.7 

    * Fixed small bugs: sending images to STDOUT
                        fixed bug in saving multiple frames


Feb 20, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>
	
    * Version 0.1.6 

    * Changed create_from_xpm commands in kmc_view.pl for newer gnome-perl.


Wed Jan 28, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>
	
    * Version 0.1.5 

    * Finished multiple frame transfers with various combinations of command
      line options and trigger settings. 


Tue Jan 19, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>
	
    * Version 0.1.4 

    * README: Added note to remind user to chmod /dev/sg? for non-root use.

    * kmc.c: get_frame now calls get_device_info2() instead of 
             get_device_info() (ie. use read/write instead of ioctl)
             so non-root users can run.

    * kmc.c: rewrote kmc_short_query to use read/write instead of ioctl

    * kmc.c: got rid of get_device_info() which used ioctl and moved
             get_device_info2() to get_device_info.

    * kmc_utils: (note: all ioctl has been removed )

    * Now, all options which do not transfer images from a KMC should
      run as non-root, and on systems without a KMC (ie. should
      properly probe other sga devices for vendor and product) if 
      /dev/sga, ... are rw enabled for other. 


Mon Jan 18, 1999	Dan Mueth	<d-mueth@uchicago.edu>

    * Version 0.1.3 complete

    * Cleaned up Makefile.  Added install, tar, and uninstall to Makefile.
