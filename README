kmc_utils -- utilities for interfacing a Kodak Motion Corder Analyzer(KMC) fast

Overview
--------
This is version 0.3.2 of kmc_utils.  This package consists of several 
utilities for use of Kodak Motion Corder Analyzers (KMC's) (both color 
and monochrome) under Linux. The KMC's have a SCSI-2 interface for 
transfering images and a serial interface for remote control of the KMC.  
The eventual goal of kmc_utils will be to have both command line and 
GUI(Perl/GTK, Gnome-aware) interfaces for both SCSI and serial 
communcations with KMC's.

Availability
------------
kmc_utils has a web page at 
	http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/~muet/linux/kmc/kmc_utils.html  
This is also where the latest release of kmc_utils can be found.

Notes About this Release
------------------------
This software is still under development.  The programs kmc_read and 
kmc_control should be usable.  Any other utilities may not be at all
usable.

Before You Begin
----------------
kmc_read, the program used to read frames from Kodak Motion Corder Analyzers,  
require generic SCSI support.  Your kernel should be compiled with support 
for your particular SCSI driver as well as generic SCSI support.  If you 
are using `make config', this is done as follows:
       *
       * SCSI support
       *
       SCSI support? (CONFIG_SCSI) [n] y
       *
       * SCSI support type (disk, tape, CDrom)
       *
        ...
       Scsi generic support (CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG) [n] y
       *
       * SCSI low-level drivers
       *
kmc_read and kmc_view use the generic SCSI support in the kernel.  Thus, 
the kernel version may effect these applications. For recent kernels 
( >1.3.98 ), one should not encounter any problems.


Installation
------------
Typical users should:
	1) (If you have a recent KMC, you may need to uncomment the line
		EXTRA=-DREVERSED_RECORD_RATES=1
		line in the Makefile.) 
	2) make 
	3) make install
	4) You may need to use chmod to give rw permission for /dev/sg? to non-root users.  eg:		chmod go+rw /dev/sga
    5) If you have a recent Gtk+, you may do: make kmc_play


Notes about Time Lapse Triggering and Random Triggering
-------------------------------------------------------
A KMC can be set to RANDOM mode and remotely triggered with an 
external TTL signal or a software trigger using the serial connection.
The program kmc_control has options allowing one to send a software
trigger every T milliseconds for N times. It should be noted that the 
KMC's cannot be reliably triggered within an interval less than 100ms.
It should also be noted that to transfer images from a KMC to a PC
which were acquired in RANDOM mode, the entire memory must be filled
with frames.  For this reason, kmc_control will grab extra frames at
the end of a Time Lapse Triggering run until the memory is full and
the KMC returns to LIVE mode.


Note about Record Rates
-----------------------
Older KMC BIOS's had a bug which reversed the 30fps and 125fps values.
If you have an older BIOS, you will need to uncomment the appropriate
line in the Makefile.


Note about transfering images from a KMC
----------------------------------------
A KMC must be in "Live" mode to properly transfer images on the SCSI 
bus.  Transfers done in "Playback" mode tend to be unreliable. 


Note about adding and removing devices "on-the-fly".
---------------------------------------------------
Under some circumstances, it may be convenient to add or remove a KMC
from a SCSI chain without rebooting(ie. if you have to "share"
your KMC).  If a KMC was added to the SCSI chain after the machine was 
booted, it can be added using:

	echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 5 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
(where 0 0 5 0 should be replaced with the HOST ID, CHANEL, SCSI ID, LUN).

To see which devices are identified (and their HOST ID, CHANEL, SCSI ID, LUN):

	cat /proc/scsi/scsi

Devices can be removed similarly to how they were added:
	echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 5 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi

For more information, see the SCSI-Programming-HOWTO.

WARNING:  	This should not be done on a scsi chain with a filesystem which
			is being accessed.


Warning/Disclaimer
------------------
Bad SCSI programming could hang the SCSI bus, which would be particularly 
bad if you have SCSI hard drives mounted on the same SCSI bus as the KMC.  
These utilities are provided with no explicit or implicit warranties.  Use 
at your own risk.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any problems or questions
about kmc_utils.  I would also be interested to know how well this software
works for different configurations and what types of applications people are
using it for.
